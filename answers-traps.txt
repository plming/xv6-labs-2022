# RISC-V assembly
* According to calling convention, a0~a7 are used to pass arguments.
* There's no function calls, because compiler optimized with inline function.
* printf is located on 0x630.
* register ra's value is 0x38 after jalr.
* The output is "HE110 World". For big-endian machine, set i as 0x726c6400.
  There's no need to change 57616 to different value, because endian doesn't matter for hexadecimal representation.
* Garbage value on register a2 will be printed. It's undefined behavior.
